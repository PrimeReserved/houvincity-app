    <SubTitle>Database</SubTitle>
    <Link href="https://www.sanity.io/" className="tooltip font-bold text-customPrimary" data-tip="Learn more">Sanity</Link> uses a proprietary, hosted database infrastructure to manage and store content. Unlike traditional databases that you might manage yourself, Sanity's backend is entirely managed by Sanity.io. This managed service is optimized for real-time collaborative editing and querying, offering high performance and scalability without requiring users to handle database operations directly.

Here are a few key points about Sanity's backend:

- **Managed Service**: Sanity provides a fully managed backend, meaning you don't have to set up, maintain, or scale the database infrastructure yourself.
- **GROQ**: Sanity uses GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) as its query language, allowing for flexible and powerful data retrieval.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: The backend supports real-time updates and collaborative editing, making it ideal for dynamic content management needs.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Sanity's infrastructure is designed to handle large-scale applications, offering high availability and fast response times.

This approach allows developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the complexities of database management.
